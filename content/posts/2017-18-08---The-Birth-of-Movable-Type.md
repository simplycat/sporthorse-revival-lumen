# I work harder than most people I know.

I was born with that kind of drive, but I was blessed with an early education that taught me how to hone it. I had a tumultuous time grinding through college, mostly because all I wanted most was to ride. I was always short on money and always short on time.

My Freshman year I spent in nestled between mountains at Randolph College, formerly Randolph Macon Woman's College, in Lynchburg, Virginia. When I worked for Billie, we had attended a horse show at the Randolph College Riding Center. Although it was no Virginia Horse Center, it sure was the second nicest riding facility I had ever seen. Three outdoor arenas, my personal favorite being the giant red clay "dust bowl" that sat the center of the bottom of rolling hills. There was so much open space to ride, to roam, to be young and misunderstood.

Randolph College had some of the toughest, smartest professors I had ever encountered. Dr. Goff's class on Development Psychology was my personal favorite. His format: you bring yourself, you bring your textbook, and you come ready to converse on the chapter assigned the night before. There was no riding. No assignments. No homework. Just brilliant, raw, engaging rhetoric between a group of 10 or 12 students seated around a large swath of desks arranged so we would all face one another in a circle. I give this class much of the credit for my ability to start, maintain, and hold conversation on any given topic.

Our riding instructor, J.T. Tallon, was notorious for running a very tight ship. When you showed up to ride, your shirt was tucked in, you wore a belt with your breeches, and you wouldn't dare have your hair in anything but a hairnet bunched up underneath your helmet.

> "This sport is about presentation. And presentation begins with how you show up to the barn. A tidy rider is a precise rider. Precision is key."

I can remember one particularly terrifying group practice session for an upcoming IHSA show. The IHSA circuit on the East Coast is highly competitive; these girls practically emerged from the womb wearing pearls and riding horses. I was so out of place in the world of Ralph Lauren and horses that cost more than most people's cars.

One of the riders began her course. A few jumps in, her horse refused a fence and she fell off. Everyone watched and stayed dead quiet, anticipating a J.T. Tallon.

> "Well, what the hell are you waiting for? Get back on the damn horse."

The girl grabbed her reins and began to walk her horse to the mounting block at the opposite end of the ring.

> "Did I say you could use a mounting block? Get back on your horse. Now." he roared.

We all watched in horror as she attempted a ground mount, a very difficult maneuver to do in an English saddle. It requires not only extreme flexibility, but also enough muscle to pull yourself up high enough to swing the other leg over. It is something I have never mastered, mostly because it's terrible on a horse's spine and really should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

She struggled.

And struggled.

And struggled.

The silence became uncomfortable. J.T. realized he was being ridiculous and, much more quietly, let her know she was allowed to use the block. She got back on her horse, finished the course and managed to stay on. We all cheered.

I can remember being at a horse show at the Virginia Horse Center and taking my dark bay Thoroughbred out of his stall to graze on some grass and stretch his legs. J.T. began yelling at me a few hundred yards away, and I could barely make out what he was saying.

> "What the hell do you think you're doing taking your horse outside of his stall looking like that?"

I looked at him and cocked my head, entirely baffled by his comment.

> "His tail! Oh my god, his tail. It has shavings in it. Go take him back and groom him properly. I can't be seen with horses like that."

That was the last time I ever forgot to groom a tail.

Needless to say, after my freshman year it was clear that Randolph College was not for me. I was bullied. A lot. The worst offender being my New Jersey roommate, who was downright awful during finals week after she was punished by our Lacrosse coach for attending a party that I wasn't invited to. The team had to do 5am sprints during finals week, and I refused, because my grades were more important than what a group of girls that weren't even nice to me.

I transferred back home to Northern Illinois University, where the people were much more real and humble than they were on the East Coast. The IHSA team left a lot to be desired, having nearly no funding from the school and mostly green or unpredictable horses pulled from slaughter pens or donated by people who could no longer afford their older, usually half-broken, horse. So I started writing emails.

I wrote probably 10 e-mails to 10 different barns all around Northern Illinois explaining my background and interest in working there. I offered to ride or teach lessons. I only got one reply, and that was from Debbie McIntyre.

To be continued...
