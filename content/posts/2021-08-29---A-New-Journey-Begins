# Every great journey starts with one step.

I've made the decision to purchase a green, off-the-track American Thoroughbred. Most people in the hunter and jumper arenas can be found on top of imported Warmbloods - mostly from Europe. While these horses are beautiful, I learned firsthand just how dangerous power in the wrong direction can be.

On one frigid January morning in Florida I was having a particularly rushed and out-of-the-ordinary day. Since the beginning of the winter show season, I had been working as an Assistant Barn Manager and rider for a large breeding and sales operation that was situated in Grand Prix Village. We had a barn of 20 something horses, all under the age of 6. If you ever need a reminder of just how mortal you are, try a hand at working with young, athletic, wildly unpredictable Warmbloods.

The arena sand was still mostly frozen from the winter freeze the night before. For some reason, Sergio had not dragged it like he usually did, which meant it was extra solid. I paid little attention and swung my leg over Souther Star, a 17.2hh black gelding with very little white markings, and of course, a star on his face. I had been warned by the Barn Manager at the beginning of the season:

> "This is the oldest and first horse we ever trained in our operation. 95% of the time he is a perfect gentleman. 5% of the time he can be very bad.
> He's even gotten a few Olympians off. So, be careful!"

Though the season was just gaining momentum for that year, I felt as if I had gotten to know Star over the past few months. I had only ever seen the perfect gentleman side, with an occasional small kick out or buck. Nothing I couldn't handle. I was in my twenties and fairly convinced I was invisible after multiple previous brushes with death in the saddle - and one time only halfway in the saddle (a story for another day) - and that particular day I had no reason to believe Star was going to act any different.

I had selected to use draw reins, like I often did, to get him to better round through the neck and push through the hind. At the age of 7, he was quite educated on the flat and had most of the buttons. While I was just beginning to warm up, the arena was quickly filling with numerous riders I had never seen before. I was suddenly feeling like I was in a constant traffic jam, having to ride around and in-between other wildly unpredictable horses with even less predictable European and South American riders. Men in this sport can be not only intimidating, but can carry a strong energy with them that permeates throughout the arena and can light up even some of the quietest horses. I rounded my least favorite corner - the one where the alligator pond met the giant 20 foot hedges that freaked most of the horses out because they could hear, but they could not see, what was happening on the other side.

I cut across the diagonal to ask for a lead change when slowly, but obviously intentionally, Star ran me right into a jump standard and I lightly fell off his side, but landed on my feet. For a moment, I was pretty impressed with my ability to land so elegantly - usually falls are not so graceful. That moment was quickly shattered when the head trainer - and farm owner - began yelling at me in his baratone voice.

> "Get back on that damn horse and make him go forward."

Not wanting to disappoint, I climbed back to the top of the mounting block and swung a leg over. I could sense an energy I had never felt permeate from Star before. He found like a tightly wound coil that was just waiting for the right moment to explode. But my sixth sense was quickly muted by an even louder command from the same voice.

> "What the hell are you waiting for? Go forward!"

With that I tightened my four reins, shoved my heels down, and picked up a left lead canter down the longside with the 20' brush hedges. I could hear the bustling of the area next to us and tried to block out all of the eyes that felt like were burning holes into me while I rode. Star's energy began to build as the head trainer continued to yell "Forward!" from across the arena. With each canter step, I felt myself losing a little more control. And then the crow hops started.

##### Crow hop 1.

##### Crow hop 2.

##### Crow hop 3.

#### Crow hop 4.

### Crow hop 5.

## Crow hop 6.

## Crow hop 7.

# POW!

I lost count after 7, which is exactly the moment when my leg muscles refused to grip. I felt a sharp pop from my tail bone. My fingers instinctly let go of the reins and my feet came out of the stirrups. Star had built up momentum in the same fashion as a bucking bronco, with his 8th maneuver being similar to a Mortal Combat final blow, where he planted both front feet and kicked his hind legs so high they went past his head. And I catapulted.

I landed some 40 feet away from where I was unseated. I am told I flipped in the air. All I know is I cracked sand with my shoulder first, then my head, followed by my hip. My entire right body seized. And without thought, I attempted to stand for fear he would come after me. I had never felt such a bad energy from a horse I had ridden in my entire life and I was just certain he was coming to finish the job.

My legs refused to hold me as I flopped back into the sand onto my back.

Staring at the sky that day, I had no idea that fall was going to change my entire life.

That fall is where this story begins.

It took me nearly half a decade to get back to the kind of riding I used to do. The damage to my body, my confidence, and my soul was more that I ever thought I could burden. My road had been long - and painful, and heartbreaking, and frustrating - but I kept going.

This is a story about second chances.

Will you join me on this journey?
