I write because it is my passion.

I used to write for a plethora of equestrian magazines a few years ago, but the pay was terrible and I was fed up with seeing my truthful articles butchered to make them portray a completely unattainable lifestyle.

I'm here to bring some truth to the equestrian media, because I'm not getting paid to write this blog.

These are my experiences and to the best of my recollection, they are true and accurate.

I welcome inquiries of all kinds.

Stay safe. Stay humble. Stay real.

## Do you like my blog? I can build you one.

During the height of the uncertain time of the pandemic, I found myself inspired to create a business that could help to elevate small and medium-sized brands to compete in the digital space. As the entire economy shifted to digital, I wanted to be able to offer my unique skillset to those in need of minimalist, lightning fast, superior web experiences. Say goodbye to cookie consents, and say hello to the new uninterruped user experience. Because building upon earned and owned media is the only way you will be able to take on the big dogs. Let us help.
